  BuildingBloCS’ June Conference is back with a bang to teach participants the <b>applications of AI</b>, 
  which has become more prominent in our lives today. We have specially designed <i>three different 
  tracks</i> based on prior experience: Beginner, in which we will introduce Python and various 
  beginner-friendly AI libraries; Intermediate, where we will guide you through the ecosystem of 
  AI libraries that are commonly used; and finally Advanced, where we will take a deep dive into 
  theory and also deploying your AI applications. Across the three conference days, we hope that 
  participants will forge friendships, hone their skills, and apply what they've learnt in our very own <b>hackathon</b>!
faq:
- q: Must I go for all the workshops in my track?
  a: You are highly encouraged to attend all the workshops, as content from some workshops may build on previous workshops. All skills will be taught progressively, so it may be harder to catch up if you miss one.
- q: Why should I sign up? Is it free?
  a: It's a free, fun and easy way to learn new skills about AI and computing! What more could you ask for?
- q: What if something pops up and I can't make it? 
  a: Please indicate that you are not coming via the lu.ma interface.
- q: What is a "hackathon"? Is it compulsory?
  a: A hackathon is a competition where you'll have to work in teams to create an application based on a theme provided. It's a great way to practice your skills, however, it is not compulsory to encourage everyone to learn and attend.
- q: What are the prizes? When will I get them?
  a: We can't divulge any information about the prizes, but they will be given out after the finals, on Friday, 14th June!
- q: How will the hackathon groups be allocated? Can I choose my teammates?
  a: For this hackathon, we will be allocating the groups for you. However, if you (mutually) indicate someone you'll like to work with, we'll take that into consideration. Any other empty slots will be filled randomly, taking into account your age.
