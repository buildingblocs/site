excerpt: The June Conference, centered around AI, teaches everything from Python basics to creating machine learning models. Whether you're new to AI or a seasoned developer, there's plenty to explore and learn!
desc: >-
  Centered around AI, our June Conference aims to teach all participants interesting concepts related to using and 
  programming AI. From a quick introduction to python, to making full fledge machine learning models, we have 
  something for everyone! Whether you're looking to learn more about AI/Computing, or a seasoned professional 
  looking to learn more, we welcome everyone with open arms! Feel free to browse our stunning lineup of workshops 
  that'll help you in your computer science journey.
faq:
- q: Must I go for all the workshops in my track?
  a: You are highly encouraged to attend all the workshops, as content from some workshops may build on previous workshops. All skills will be taught progressively, so it may be harder to catch up if you miss one.
- q: Why should I sign up? Is it free?
  a: It's a free, fun and easy way to learn new skills about AI and computing! What more could you ask for?
- q: What if something pops up and I can't make it? 
  a: Please open a ticket in the BuildingBloCS server so we can update your registration status.
- q: What is a "hackathon"? Is it compulsory?
  a: A hackathon is a competition where you'll have to work in teams to create an application based on a theme provided. It's a great way to practice your skills, however, it is not compulsory to encourage everyone to learn and attend.
- q: What are the prizes? When will I get them?
  a: The prizes will be announced closer to the event dates on Discord. Rest assured, there are plenty to be won!
- q: How will the hackathon groups be allocated? Can I choose my teammates?
  a: For this hackathon, we will be allocating the groups for you. However, if you (mutually) indicate someone you'll like to work with, we'll take that into consideration. Any other empty slots will be filled randomly, taking into account your age.
- q: I still have questions! Who can I contact?
  a: The fastest way to reach us is to open a ticket on our Discord server, which you can join at <a href="https://go.buildingblocs.sg/discord">go.buildingblocs.sg/discord</a> <br> However, if you are unable to use Discord, you may also shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@buildingblocs.sg">hello@buildingblocs.sg</a>
