  BuildingBloCS’ virtual March Conference aims to spark an interest in Python and Data Science by introducing 
  three beginner-level workshops on NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. We also have a lesson on Data Structures and Algorithms, providing the opportunity for participants to delve in the world of competitive programming! To put your learning to the test, a 
  three-day hackathon has been organised with attractive prizes to be won!
