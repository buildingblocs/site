  BuildingBloCS’ virtual March Conference aims to spark an interest in Python and Data Science by introducing 
  three beginner-level workshops on NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. We also have a special sharing by FOSSASIA, 
  the premier open source organisation in Asia, about data scraping! To put your learning to the test, a 
  three-day hackathon has been organised with attractive prizes to be won!
