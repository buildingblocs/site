  BuildingBloCS is back with our final conference for 2024! The theme is <b>Web Development</b>, 
  an important skill to bring websites and applications to life. We have specially curated 6
  workshops: UI/UX on Figma, Git & Github, HTML & CSS, Javascript, Databases, React & Next.js. 
  You will have the choice to pick which workshops you would like to attend. Across the three 
  conference days, we hope that you will build a better understanding of web development, forge 
  new friendships, and apply what youâ€™ve learnt in a hackathon!
