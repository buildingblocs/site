desc: >-
    BuildingBloCS is back with our final conference for 2025! The theme is <b>Web Development</b>.
    You will learn how to create websites and applications through 8 specially curated workshops:
    UI/UX on Figma, Git & Github, HTML & CSS, Javascript, Databases, Tailwind CSS, React & Next.js,
    and Anime.js. Across the three conference days, we hope that you will build a better 
    understanding of web development, forge new friendships, and apply what you’ve learnt in a 
    hackathon! Sign up now, before registration closes on 23rd November!

    <br>*In the case of oversubscription, online access will be offered through livestream.</br>
faq:
    - q: Must I go for all the workshops?
      a: Yes! The workshops are designed to build on each other, so attending all of them will help you get the most out of the conference. A participation certificate will only be given to those who attend <b>at least 2 days</b> of workshops.
    - q: Why should I sign up? Is it free?
      a: It's a free, fun and easy way to learn new skills about many new topics related to computing! What more could you ask for?
    - q: What if something pops up and I can't make it?
      a: Please open a ticket in the BuildingBloCS server so we can update your registration status.
    - q: What is a "hackathon"? Is it compulsory?
      a: A hackathon is a competition where you'll have to work in teams to create an application based on a theme provided. It's a great way to practice your skills, however, it is not compulsory to encourage everyone to learn and attend.
    - q: What are the prizes? When will I get them?
      a: We can't divulge any information about the prizes, but they will be shipped out after the finals, on Monday, 15th December!
    - q: How will the hackathon groups be allocated? Can I choose my teammates?
      a: For this hackathon, we will be allocating the groups for you. However, if you (mutually) indicate someone you'll like to work with, we'll take that into consideration. Any other empty slots will be filled randomly, taking into account your age.
    - q: Am I allowed to use AI during the hackathon?
      a: While <b>we do permit the use of AI during the competition</b>, we hope that you will not overuse it, as being able to code on your own is extremely beneficial to your own learning.
    - q: I still have questions! Who can I contact?
      a: The fastest way to reach us is to open a ticket on our Discord server, which you can join at <a href="https://go.buildingblocs.sg/discord">go.buildingblocs.sg/discord</a> <br> However, if you are unable to use Discord, you may also shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@buildingblocs.sg">hello@buildingblocs.sg</a>
